# skel — Layer 5 correction history

## Pilot build, Inferno 1 (2026-07-13)

First build (`uv run skel/skel.py inferno -c 1 -m ollama:gemma4:31b-it-qat`) hit 3/3 retry
failures on lines 55-60, all identical: the model cited `59.2 venendomi` (gerund `venire` fused
with the enclitic dative pronoun `mi` — Layer 2 lemma `venire+mi`, no separate token exists for
`mi`) as its own argument, tripping the hard self-citation check. Fixed in `SYSTEM_PROMPT`
(`skel/skel.py`) with an explicit rule: a verb token with a fused enclitic pronoun encodes that
pronoun internally; do not cite it, or the predicate's own position, as a separate argument. No
`derive_unit` change — this is a token-citation constraint the prompt needs to state, not a
divergence the deterministic derivation gets wrong.

After that fix, the canto built clean: **0 hard** violations, all 136 lines committed.

### Soft-divergence triage (`--check`: 0 hard, 136 soft before the fixes below)

Every soft violation was inspected by comparing the LLM's rows against `derive_unit`'s output
for the same parse unit (not just the violation's one-line detail). Four distinct root causes
emerged, none of them the mixed-copular-style pattern the *Handoff* section predicted as the
likely largest class — that pattern (`è root`/`cosa attr` vs `amara`/`è cop`) barely appears in
canto 1; the actual largest class is different and still open (see below).

1. **`xcomp`-complement subject/object control (largest class, ~50+ of 136 soft violations)** —
   copular-raising verbs (`sembiava carca`, `parea fioco`) and causative `fare` (`fé... viver
   grame`, `fai... mesti`) both take an `xcomp` complement whose own implicit subject
   `derive_unit` currently leaves unfilled (only `conj`-chain subject sharing is implemented, not
   `xcomp`/`ccomp` control). The LLM consistently filled it in, but with an important wrinkle:
   `sembiare`/`parere` are **subject-control** (the xcomp's implicit subject = the matrix
   predicate's own subject) while `fare` is **object-control** (the xcomp's implicit subject =
   the matrix predicate's direct object) — a lexically-governed distinction, not one derivable
   from UD deprels alone. **Deferred, not fixed**: extending `derive_unit` would mean encoding a
   verb-specific control lexicon, which sits uneasily with this layer's "no semantic frame, UD
   deprels only" design (see `dante_corpus/skel.py`'s module docstring and PLAN.md's *Out of
   scope*). Revisit once more cantos are built and the pattern's shape (how many verbs, how
   reliably subject- vs object-control splits along closed verb classes) is actually measured,
   per the *measure-then-freeze* discipline — a single canto is too small a sample to freeze a
   control lexicon against.
2. **Elliptical predicate nominals with no verb token at all** (`mantoani per patrïa ambedui` —
   "[we were] Mantuans by homeland", copula elided; `Non omo, omo già fui` — "[I was] not a man,
   [but] a man I once was", first `omo` has no copula at all) — `derive_unit`'s two predicate
   rules both require either a clause-head deprel or a verb token; an elided-copula predicate
   nominal satisfies neither structurally. Genuinely unexpressable by the current derivation, not
   a bug. **Exemption, not fixed** — same shape as `dep/CORRECTIONS.md`'s substantivization
   cases: a real reading the mechanism can't cite, checked by hand against its terzina, not a
   parse error.
3. **NP-membership soft-check false positives, fixed deterministically** (`dante_corpus/skel.py`
   `validate_unit`) — two sub-patterns, both mechanical widenings of the membership check, not
   changes to `derive_unit` or any artifact:
   - Relative pronoun `che`/`ch'` cited as a `subj`/`obj`/`obl` argument is correctly Layer-5
     usage, but Layer 2 tags `che`/`ch'` inconsistently between `pronoun` and `conjunction` even
     in its relative use (`morph/CORRECTIONS.md`'s `che`/`ch'` mistag section), so the
     POS-based pronoun check missed it. Fixed by also accepting the word form itself
     (`che`/`ch'`/`cui`/`qual`/`quale`/`chi`) regardless of the frozen POS tag.
   - An adverbial oblique (`quivi`, `là`, `sù`, `dietro`) is a legitimate `obl`/`obl:*` argument
     with no NP to cite — adverbs were simply never in the membership check's acceptance set.
     Fixed by accepting an adverb-POS token specifically for `obl`/`obl:*` roles (not for
     `subj`/`obj`/`iobj`, where an adverb would still be a genuine miscitation).
   - Tests: `tests/test_skel.py`'s four new `test_validate_unit_membership_*` cases.
   - Effect on canto 1: 13 -> 2 membership violations (11 resolved: 6 relative-pronoun instances,
     5 adverb instances). `--check`: **136 -> 125 soft** (0 hard throughout).
4. **Two single-instance boundary cases, left as-is** — inferno 1:59 `'ncontro` (the model, having
   been told not to cite the fused-enclitic argument of `venendomi` directly per item 1's build
   fix, cited the adjacent preposition instead — a defensible fallback, not wrong, but not a
   nominal citation either); inferno 1:110 `l'` (elided direct-object clitic `lo`, graphically
   identical to an elided article, so Layer 2 tags it `article` — genuinely ambiguous without
   deeper morph-layer work, out of scope for this pass). Both remain flagged by the membership
   check; revisit only if the pattern recurs at scale.

**Current state**: `skel/inferno/01.tsv` — **0 hard, 125 soft** (`uv run skel/skel.py inferno -c
1 --check`). Item 1 (xcomp control) is the dominant remaining class and is an open design
question, not a bug to silently fix; items 2 and 4 are structural/POS-ambiguity limits expected
to recur at low, tolerable rates across the corpus. No canto-2+ build has been run yet.
