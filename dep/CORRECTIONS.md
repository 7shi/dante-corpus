# dep — Layer 4 correction history

## `RELCL_HEAD` substantivization flag (2026-07-12)

After the LLM-based `--fix` pass (unit regeneration, `make -C dep fix`) resolved every
deprel-vocabulary and multiple-root soft violation, all **132** remaining soft violations were
of a single kind: `acl:relcl head is 'POS', not nominal`. Mechanically enumerating every case
(canticle, canto, head word, head POS, head's own deprel — no model call, just reading the
committed TSVs) showed these were not parse errors at all, and the model had made the same
judgment call every time `--fix` regenerated the unit, which is why blind regeneration never
improved them:

- **Closed-class substantivized pronouns/quantifiers (95 of 132)** — demonstratives (`quel`,
  `quello`, `quelli`, `que'`, `tal`, `tale`, `cotesti`, …), indefinites (`altro`, `altri`, `molti`,
  `alcuna`, …), and cardinal/quantifier numerals (`due`, `tre`, `cinque`, `mille`, …) used
  pronominally with an elided noun (`quei due che 'nsieme vanno` — "those two who go together";
  `più di mille... piovuti` — "more than a thousand... fallen"). Archaic/poetic Italian relies on
  this ellipsis constantly; Layer 2 correctly tags the word's literal part of speech
  (adjective/numeral), which is simply not what UD's "nominal antecedent" check expects.
- **One-off substantivized adjectives/participles/infinitives (26 of 132)**, checked individually
  against their terzina context, same shape: `le triste` ("the sad women", inferno 20:121),
  `li 'mpaniati` ("the birdlime-caught", inferno 22:149), `li eletti` ("the elect", purgatorio
  19:76), `libero voler` (infinitive-as-noun "free will", purgatorio 16:76), `il primo` ("the
  first one", paradiso 8:111), etc.
- **Locative/quotative antecedents (10 of 132)** — `là dove`/`là 've`/`là onde` ("there where"),
  a fixed relative-locative construction where the place adverb stands in for a place noun-phrase,
  plus one quoted-word-as-noun case (`un tal «sì»`, purgatorio 31:14). Same non-nominal-POS,
  legitimate-antecedent shape as the two categories above, so folded into the same flag rather
  than inventing a second mechanism.

Each of the 131 candidate positions was checked against its terzina context before flagging (not
a blanket rule for these word forms in general — the same caution `NO_NP`/`CONT_NEXT` used in
`morph/CORRECTIONS.md`). One case did **not** qualify: inferno 19:73-74
(`son li altri tratti / che precedetter me simoneggiando`) attached the relative clause to
`tratti` (a passive participle, "[they are] dragged") rather than to `altri` ("the others"), its
more plausible antecedent — a genuine mis-attachment, not a substantivization, reproduced
identically across `--fix` regenerations (see below for its resolution).

Following `np.py`'s `NO_NP`/`CONT_NEXT` precedent, each qualifying token's Layer-2 `note` column
now carries a machine-readable `RELCL_HEAD` flag, comma-separated alongside any existing note
(e.g. `archaic` -> `archaic, RELCL_HEAD`; an empty note becomes `RELCL_HEAD` on its own).
`dante_corpus/dep.py`'s `_is_nominal` now treats a non-nominal-POS head as valid for `acl:relcl`
if its note carries `RELCL_HEAD`. 129 distinct `(line, token)` positions were flagged across 71
cantos (a few positions are the head of more than one relative clause, e.g. inferno 11:62-63 both
citing `62.5 quel`, so the flagged-position count is slightly below the 131 qualifying rows).

`dep --check` after this flagging pass: **0 hard, 1 soft** (down from 132; the `tratti` case
above). `morph --check` and `np --check` remain 0 hard / 0 soft — the new flag doesn't intersect
`_needs_np`'s exemption set, so Layer 3 is unaffected.

## Inferno 19:73-74 `tratti`/`altri` mis-attachment, hand-corrected (2026-07-12)

The last soft violation, re-run through `make -C dep fix` once more, was unchanged
(`0/1 unit(s) improved`) — confirming it wasn't build noise but a systematic, reproducible parse
choice. Unlike the `RELCL_HEAD` cases, `tratti` here is a genuine passive-voice predicate
(`son... tratti` = "are dragged"), not a substantivized noun standing on its own — `altri` ("the
others") is the real subject and the relative clause's real antecedent. Following the same
hand-verified, single-instance correction the `Rife` mistag used (`morph/CORRECTIONS.md`), the
three affected rows in `dep/inferno/19.tsv` were corrected directly (no model call): `li` (det)
and `precedetter` (`acl:relcl`) now point to `altri` (73.8) instead of `tratti` (73.9); `altri`
itself becomes `nsubj` of `son`; `tratti` becomes `acl` of `altri` (a participial modifier, "the
others, dragged"). `altri`'s Layer-2 `note` picked up `RELCL_HEAD` (it wasn't previously an
`acl:relcl` head anywhere, so hadn't needed the flag).

`dep --check`: **0 hard, 0 soft** — Layer 4 fully clean across all 100 cantos.
